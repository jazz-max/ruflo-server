## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.2] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **stdio child leak in `server.mjs` (`ruflo mcp start` zombies).** The 1.1.0 auto-reconnect (`transport.onclose` + `callTool-failure` retry) was not single-flight: N concurrent HTTP requests that hit `Not connected` each called `connectToRuflo()` in parallel and spawned N fresh `ruflo mcp start` processes. The global `client` was overwritten by the last winner, but the previous children kept running — their stdio pipes were held by transport objects no longer referenced anywhere. Over 4 days in production this accumulated to **123 orphaned processes and 4.2 GB of RAM** (cgroup `anon`).
- **Single-flight `connectToRuflo`** via `connectingPromise` — concurrent callers all await the same in-flight promise.
- **Explicit SIGTERM of the previous child** before spawning a new one: `transport.close()` is fire-and-forget so the SDK's 0–4 s grace period never blocks reconnect.
- **Stale-transport `onclose` is now ignored** (`transport !== currentTransport`) — otherwise the death-throes of an orphaned child triggered an extra reconnect.
- Stress test: 5 rounds × 8 concurrent requests + `kill -9` the child mid-flight. Each round produced exactly 1 reconnect, 1 child, RAM steady at 79 MiB. Pre-patch the same scenario leaked 4–5 orphans per round.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Docs: missing volumes in embedding examples.** All three variants in the README (en + ru) mounted only `ruflo-pgdata`, omitting `ruflo-memory:/app/.swarm` and `ruflo-state:/app/.claude-flow`. As a result, `docker compose pull && up -d` recreated the container and lost `memory.db`. Volume mappings were added to all variants, plus a prominent WARNING block at the top of the "Embedding as a service" section.
- New section [Migrating an existing deployment to volumes](README.md#migrating-an-existing-deployment-to-volumes) — a step-by-step migration plan that moves live data into a named volume without loss, for users who already deployed without volumes.

### Added
- **Runtime warning in `entrypoint.sh`**: uses `mountpoint -q` to verify that `/app/.swarm` and `/app/.claude-flow` are mounted from a volume. If not, it prints a prominent block to the container's `stderr` with the exact YAML snippet to paste into compose. Runs on every start.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added
- **SONA pattern bridge** in the client bundle (`templates/intelligence-bridge.cjs` + hooks in `hook-handler.cjs`). Every Claude Code action (`Edit` / `Bash` / `task-complete` / `session-end`) is written as a pattern in the `pattern` namespace via `hooks_intelligence_pattern-store`. An aggregated summary is stored on `session-end`.
- **Auto-reconnect** for the stdio child `ruflo mcp start` in `server.mjs`. When the child dies (`transport.onclose`), a back-off timer between 0.5 and 5 s respawns it automatically. `callTool` retries transparently on `Not connected` / `Connection closed`.
- **Persistent stderr log** for the ruflo CLI: `/app/.swarm/ruflo-stderr.log` (on a volume, survives container restarts). Each reconnect attempt is recorded there with its reason.
- **Extended `/health`**: now includes `state`, `serverStartedAt`, `currentConnectedSince`, `reconnectCount`, `reconnectFailures`, `lastReconnectAt`, `lastReconnectReason`. Returns `503` when the transport is not in `ready` state (the Docker healthcheck no longer lies).
- **Stub files for `system_health`**: `/app/.claude-flow/{config.json,memory/store.json}` are created by `entrypoint.sh` so clients stop suggesting `ruflo init`. Alongside them sits the migration marker `.migrated-to-sqlite` — without it, `memory_store` crashes with a null-deref on the empty stub.
- **`intelligence-bridge.cjs` is shipped** through `/setup` and `/update-bundle`. `/update-bundle` now always overwrites helpers (they are server-owned).
- **Operational notes** in the README (en + ru): known quirks of `system_health`, `claude_flow.embeddings`, `memory_bridge_status`, and the background controllers.

### Fixed
- **Crash `memory_store: Cannot convert undefined or null to object`** — the `.migrated-to-sqlite` migration marker disables the code path in `memory-tools.js` that treated the stub `store.json` as a legacy dump and called `Object.keys(legacyStore.entries).length` on `undefined`.
- **Lost writes when the stdio child crashes**: prior to 1.1.0, the container could spend 13+ hours replying `Not connected` to every MCP call while `/health` returned `200 OK` (using the `tools/list` cache from startup). The child is now auto-restarted and `/health` signals degraded state.
- **Documentation inaccuracies**: references to `supergateway` were removed (not used in this build — we have our own Express proxy `server.mjs`). `all-MiniLM-L6-v2 384-dim` was corrected to `1536-dim (RuVector)`, with a note about the active sql.js (768-dim) backend.
- **Backup instructions** rewritten (en + ru): the volume to back up is `<service>-memory`, not a `pg_dump` — the primary memory lives in `/app/.swarm/memory.db`, while PostgreSQL is normally empty and used only for `ruvector import/export`.

### Reported upstream
- [ruvnet/ruflo#1647](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo/issues/1647): the `trajectory-*` API does not persist tracking data to SQLite, plus null-derefs in `hooks_intelligence_stats` / `memory_bridge_status` / migration code in `memory_store`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-22

First tracked version. Main features at this point:

- Docker wrapper around the `ruflo` CLI: `server.mjs` (Express + MCP stdio client) + Dockerfile + docker-compose.
- `/mcp` (Streamable HTTP JSON-RPC), `/health`, `/stats` (with `dbSizeKB` and intelligence metrics).
- `/setup` and `/update-bundle` — self-configuring shell scripts that install `.claude/helpers/{auto-memory-hook.mjs,hook-handler.cjs,statusline.cjs}` + `.claude/{skills,agents,commands}` into the target project.
- Memory bridge: `auto-memory-hook.mjs` — imports patterns from ruflo-personal on `SessionStart`, syncs on `Stop`.
- Optional PostgreSQL/pgvector (lean mode if PG is unavailable). Auto-initialises the `claude_flow` schema via `ruvector init`.
- Multi-instance support (several containers on different ports, each with its own PG database — `ruflo_alpha`, `ruflo_beta`).
- CI: GitHub Actions builds the image on every push to `main` and weekly (Mon 06:00 UTC), pushes `latest` + `<sha>` to Docker Hub.
- Bilingual documentation (en + ru).
